## Installation

1. Download the latest version of IIBacFinder from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14292149). Of note, do not clone the package directly from the GitHub repository as it is incomplete

```
wget -O IIBacFinder.tar.gz https://zenodo.org/records/14292149/files/IIBacFinder.tar.gz?download=1
tar -zxvf IIBacFinder.tar.gz
```

2. Download and clone the execution environment for IIBacFinder

```
# download
wget -O env_IIBacFinder.tar.gz https://zenodo.org/records/14292149/files/env_IIBacFinder.tar.gz?download=1
# clone
mkdir -p $path/env_IIBacFinder
tar -xzf env_IIBacFinder.tar.gz -C $path/env_IIBacFinder
source $path/env_IIBacFinder/bin/activate
conda unpack
```

`$path` is where the IIBacFinder environment will be unpacked and cloned.

3. install [signalp6](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/signalp-6.0#)

*Due to license restrictions, this recipe cannot distribute signalp6 directly.*

Please download signalp-6.0d.fast.tar.gz from:  
https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/sw_request?software=signalp&version=6.0&packageversion=6.0h&platform=fast

After registering online, you will receive the link for package download via email, and then download the package locally. 

Assuming you have downloaded the package locally, then run the following command to complete the installation:  

```
signalp6-register signalp-*tar.gz
```

This will copy signalp6 into your conda environment. After this step, the installation of IIBacFinder will be complete.

*Let's say that you need to deactivateÂ the environment after the prediction, you can run*

```
source $path/env_IIBacFinder/bin/deactivate
```

## Running IIBacFinder

To confirm the successful installation and view all options, execute the command below

```
python $PATH/IIBacFinder/scripts/predict.py -h
```

`$PATH` is the directory where `IIBacFinder` was placed. 

```
usage: IIBacFinder [-h] -i INDIR [-e HMMEXCUTE] [-a AMPEP] [-r RCMD] [-s HMMSCAN] -o OUTDIR [-t THRESHOLD] [-p] [-m {single,meta}] [-v]

  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Number of threshols used, default: 20
  -p, --prodigal_short  Whether perform gene prediction using prodigal short (default: TRUE), toggle to close. This is indispensable for FASTA files.
  -m {single,meta}, --prodigal_p {single,meta}
                        Select procedure model (single or meta) in 'prodigal_short', identical to the parameter '-p'. Default is single
  -v, --version         Print out the version and exit.
```

Key parameters:

- -i: Input directory where FASTA files for prediction are located.

- -o: Output directory

- -p: If the input FASTA files are genome sequences, this parameter should remain at its default setting to run gene prediction using `prodigal_short`. If the input FASTA files are prediction results from `prodigal_short`, this parameter should be specified to skip the `prodigal_short` prediction step.

- -m: The prediction model for `prodigal_short` prediction, see for details at [prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/prodigal/wiki/gene-prediction-modes).

## Running a demo:

```
python $PATH/IIBacFinder/scripts/predict.py -i $PATH/IIBacFinder/test_fasta/ -o test_prediction
```

Prediction results can be found in `test_prediction`.
